    📊 Player Stats Guide

    - 📥 Type "Player Stats" in the Story Cards to view your current stats.
    - 🔄 Stats auto-update based on natural player input and context.
    - ✏️ To manually adjust a stat, use the format: STAT: x/maxX.
    - 🗒️ Stat change logs appear in the notes of the Player Stats Story Card.

    🧠 Gameplay Mechanics

    - ❤️ Health and 🔵 Corruption regenerate every turn.
    - ⚡ Energy decreases every turn.
    - ⚠️ Low Health or Energy leads to consequences.
    - 📈 Stats used in actions gain exp. Experience scales exponentially lower as your stats increase.
    - 🎓 When a stat is maxed, exp overflows to your main EXP pool for leveling up instead.
    - 🆙 Leveling up increases all max stats.

    📐 Scaling & Calculations

    - 🧠 Corruption scales with INTL.
    - 🛡️ X DEF = X/2 % damage reduction.
    - ➕ DEF above 100 reduces damage by an extra 0.01% per 10 points.
    - 🍀 Each point in LCK gives a 1% chance of a lucky boost.

    🎯 Talent System Guide

    - 🧠 Talents represent your character's aptitudes (e.g., Cooking, Lockpicking, Fishing).
    - ⚡ Talents consume energy points (EP) when used.
    - ✨ Casting a talent transforms it into a skill, which uses corruption (CP) instead.
    - 📝 Edit talents in the Story Card using the format: "Talent Name (Lvl) (Ep)".
    - 📚 Learn a talent by studying it and using its name repeatedly over a few turns. Ex: You [study word] Fireball.
    - 🔤 Capitalized first-letter talent names are learned faster.
    - 🧪 The system filters common words intelligently when detecting talent names.
    - 🎓 Learning talents grants INTL experience.
    - 📖 Talent learning progress is logged in the Player Talents Story Card notes.
    - 📈 Using talents levels them up. Progress is also tracked in the Story Card.

    🎯 Skills System Guide

    - 🔄 Casting a talent transforms it into a skill.
    - 📝 Edit skills in the Story Card using the format: "Skill Name (Lvl) (CP)".
    - 📈 Use skills to gain EXP — progress is logged in the Story Card.
    - 🧪 Skills upgrade every 5 levels (up to level 25), changing their name and reducing CP cost by 5%.
    - 💥 Skill power increases every 10 levels.

  📦 Inventory Help

  - Store items by typing: "You [store words]... [item name]... [inventory words]."
  - Include a number to specify quantity. Ex: "You put 2 apples in your bag."
  - Edit your inventory in the story card using the format: "Item Name (Amt)".
  - Weapons are automatically equipped when stored if no weapon is currently equipped.
  - To use an item, type: "You [use words]... [item name]... [inventory words]."
  - To drop an item, type: "You [drop words]... [item name]... [inventory words]."

    🎬 Action System Help

    - Item, talent, and skill usage requires name matching (exact or partial).
    - Vague actions are taken literally. Example: "You slice it" (slice with what?).
    - Cast skills: "You [cast verb] [skill name]."
    - Rest to recover HP, CP, and energy:
      • Light rest, moderate rest, full rest yield different recovery levels.
      • Format: "You [enter words] [sleep words]."
    - Use consumables for healing/energy. Example: "You drink a Mythical potion."
    - Use skills/talents on yourself to heal. Format: "You [heal word] [yourself] [skill/talent]."
    - ATK & SPD:
      • +10 ATK & SPD → stronger attacks
      • +10 SPD → faster actions, better dodging
      • Attacking and dodging costs energy based on your RATK or ATK, and SPD
    - Weapons
    - Placing a weapon into your inventory allows you to equip it. Equip a weapon by drawing it as in "I draw my laspistol" 
    - Once a weapon is equipped you do not need to specify which weapon you are attacking with your attacks will use ammunition from that weapon's story card.
    - Unequip a weapon by returning it to your holster as in "I return my laspistol to it's holster"
    - You may toggle fire modes on appropriate weapons by saying "I select" or "I toggle burst fire" or "overcharge". Burst fire fires three rounds, overcharge consumes all remaining ammunition
    - You may fire multiple times in one action by saying "I fire twice" or "I fire three times etc"
    - Laser weapons reload with power cells. 1 power cell = full weapon charge
